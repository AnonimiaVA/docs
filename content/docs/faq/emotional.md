Things may get chaotic at Rogue Rope Camp. For example, interacting might feel too intense at times, and/or you may feel a bit alone or alienated, without familiar comforts to rely on. But there are plenty of ways to deal with this!

Here are some tips:

* Be gentle with your body
* Seek help if you need it
* State your boundaries and communicate, whether talking with strangers or your loved ones
* Try to have the experience that makes YOU happy
* Try to connect in ways that make YOU comfortable

## Seeking Help

If you need support, let us know. There will we a list of confidants (vertrouwenspersonen) at the tent. Choose the one you feel would suit you best. Walk up to them and and tell them you need a talk. 
Your issues will be addressed to the best of our abilities. We will do our best to involve the right people to find a solution, whether it be by giving you private space, finding a nice person to talk to, or any other solution that could improve your situation.

The Rogue Rope mindset is: we never look for blame or shame, we are always focused on solutions.
