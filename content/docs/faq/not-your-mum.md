Everything you bring to the site has the potential to become **MATTER OUT OF PLACE (MOOP)**: costumes, water bottles, booze containers, inflatable chairs, hats, fruit, cigarette butts, even rope fibers can all become MOOP. Every person is responsible for their rubbish.

So, remember what your mum thought you, don't litter, put away your toys after playing, clean up after yourself.
We don't clean up after you, **I am not your mum (but you can call me daddy).**

## What should I do with my rubbish?

One of the fundamental ideas of Leave no trace is : **Pack it in, pack it out**. Everything brought at Rope Camp will have to be taken away before the end of the event.

**NEVER LET MOOP HIT THE GROUND. Clean As You Go. MOOP Attracts More MOOP. When You See Trash On The Ground, pick It Up And Take It With You.**

* **Carry a MOOP bag**. Wherever you go, carry a small bag to collect any MOOP you find.
* **Weigh items down/don’t let them blow away**: put weight on it or tie down anything that can blow away.
* If you’re a smoker, **carry a portable ashtray** such as a mint tin with you at all times. Or put butts in your pocket. **Never, ever drop butts**.
* Do not let bins overflow and MOOP get out of hand.
