A "voucher" is a unique code that you can use to buy a ticket. You will get one in the pre-pre-sale.
If you registered as a couple, you will receive 2 vouchers. If you registered as single last year, you will **also** receive 2 vouchers. Yay.

## Vouchers Are Personal!

If someone got a voucher for participating last year, and will not join us this year, the voucher is void.
You **cannot** give or sell your voucher to your friends. When the initial pre-sale is over, we will distribute vouchers to people that joined the mailing-list.

## Waiting List

If you have a voucher, and all tickets are sold out, the ticketing engine puts you on a waiting list.

## All Sales Are Final, But...

You might be able to cancel your ticket if there are people on the waiting list. You do this by [contacting us]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us"). If we need to cancel and redistribute your ticket we reserve a 15% cancellation fee.
When this refund is done, another ticket will be distributed to the people on the waiting list (first come, first served).
