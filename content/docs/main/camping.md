Dear friends, we know it can be fun to build your own little village at a festival with your friends, but unfortunately this is not an option at our camp. We have to use the campsite sparingly, so please feel free to bring the essentials, but try to minimize the space between tents. We'll be "defragmenting" like it's 1995!

But don't worry, we'll still have a chance to build a kinky village – just in the forest and in the communal areas of the camp instead.

We'll be providing electricity on the campsite. If you want to get connected, bring the longest extension cord you have and a power strip. This way, you can charge your mobile devices whenever necessary. Just a reminder: please don't connect power-hungry devices to the camping grid, like fridges, hair dryers, air conditioning units, or dishwashers.

We hope for good weather, but if it does rain, please don't dig a trench around your tent. This is explicitly mentioned in the lease and we want to leave the field in the same condition as we found it.

To help with fire safety, please try to limit smoking on the campsite between the tents. You're welcome to smoke near the fire pit, but make sure to keep it clean by disposing of your cigarette butts in the designated ash trays. If your smoke has a unique smell, that's fine – no need to hide it.

**Camping and Other Stuff to Bring**

* Your Christmas lights! Or other cool led strips. Let's make it funky at night.
* Toilet/shower facilities are indoor. The facilities are quite basic. There are 3 toilets so no smelly Dixie-toilets for us, thank you very much.
* A box cooler, or one of those supermarket insulation bags. A smaller bag or watertight container to preserve the ice, so your cooler won't become a pool.
* Please note: there is no need to bring dodgy gas stoves or other cooking gear, we will provide you with warm food.

**Sleeping**

You might be wondering if there is a possibility to sleep indoors? There is some room inside, but we'll be using that for activities. The safest option is to make sleeping arrangements outside (tent, van, camper, etc.).
