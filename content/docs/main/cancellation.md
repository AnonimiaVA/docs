## Corona Cancellation

Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room: if the event is not legal under Belgian or local laws, it shall not take place. Furthermore, in this case, everyone will receive a **full refunds** for all costs \(tickets, drink vouchers\) there are no hidden fees deducted. If you paid X euro's, we'll send you your X euro's back via bank transfer.

If you are living in a foreign country, and you are not allowed by your local laws or Belgian laws to spend time with us, you can also get a full refund.

## Orga Cancelation

In case something happens which forces us to cancel the camp, you will get a full refund.

## Personal Cancellation

If you can't attend for personal reasons \(sickness, change of plans, ... \) you can resell or gift your tickets. In this case, let the organizers know so we can check the person you want to sell your ticket to. Every participant needs to be confirmed by the orga. No point is selling your ticket to someone who's not allowed to participate. So first send a mail to the orga, with the fl name and email of your friend. We will send you both a mail with instructions on how to proceed.
If you don't know anyone to take your ticket, and we have people on the waiting list, you can get a refund of 90% of the ticket price. If we don't have people on the waiting list, we can't make any refund promises but we will do our best to make you a deal. Also in this case [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Early termination of the event.

The amount of the ticket is non-refundable if the Event has started but is terminated early, due to harsh weather, acts of nature or other conditions beyond our control.
