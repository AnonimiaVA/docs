For our regular visitors, here are the most important changes from last year:

## Timing

* Bigger, better and uncut! The party starts on Wednesday, that's one additional day of funzies.
* Pre-camp: volunteers can join on Monday.

## Infra

* We will probably host 14 people more than last year. This will enable 64 people to join the party. 
* To be able to accommodate everyone, we ask you to keep the distance between tents small.
* More rope space + bamboo suspension points.
* Two words: Bouncy Castle!
