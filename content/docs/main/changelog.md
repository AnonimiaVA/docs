For our regular visitors, here are the most important changes from last year.

## Timing

* Bigger, better and uncut! The party starts on Wednesday, that's one more day of funzies.
* Pre-camp: volunteers can join on monday.

## Infra

* We will probably host 14 people more than last year. So keep the distance between tents small.
* This will enable 64 people to join the party.
* More rope space + Bambo suspension points.
* Two words: Bouncy Castle.
