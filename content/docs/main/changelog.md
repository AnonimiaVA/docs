## Food

* You bring the cooler, we'll provide ice cubes!
* You need to bring your own booze and soda, we will still provide coffee and water.
* Breakfast: bring your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam or even peanut butter). Put it in your cooler, and we'll send someone to the bakery for fresh bread every morning.
* We **still** provide snacks in the afternoon and warm food every evening.

## Campsite

* The campsite has grown in size, so there should be enough space to pitch your tents.
* There is a little forest area to play.
* Two words: **fire pit**!
* Such much privacy!
* Showers! Here's the bad news: this year it's very primitive, compared to last year. Think of _one_ shower-cabin with two shower heads. So shower quickly, and don't use too much water.
* No more public WiFi to cover the campsite, but 4G coverage is great.
