# Food


We provide **vegetarian** and **meat** options, anything beyond that is not within the current capabilities of the kitchen. You are asked to make this choice when you sign up for a ticket. Note that to make it work, you need to stick with your choice.

If you have very specific nutrition needs \(vegan, gluten-free,organic\), I'm very sorry but this event does not have the human resources or capabilities to cater to you. We are open to help you though, and can provide those with specific needs access to the kitchen. [Get in touch]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us") to work something out.

We will also provide coffee and water free of charge for all participants.

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event, but we're confident that with your help we can make this work. So prepare your taste buds for some nice surprises.


## What to bring yourself?
* You bring your cooler, we will provide ice cubes!
* You need to bring your own drinks and soda, there will be **no bar** onsite.
* No worries, We provide bread in the morning, snacks in the afternoon and warm food every evening.
* Long story short, for the truly lazy people: bring a case of beer and a jar of Nutella, you'll be fine.

**At the bar:** The first event we provided a bar for all attendees, this was a hassle. Also people have their preferences and in the end most people brought their own drinks anyway. Let's keep this up! Bring your cooler filled with your favorite drink, some for you , some to share, we will provide the ice-cubes free of charge to keep it chilled.

**Breakfast:** Like with the drinks, provide your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam or even pindakaas). Put it in your cooler, and we'll provide the ice to keep it cool. Don't worry about bread, we'll provide you with bread every morning.
