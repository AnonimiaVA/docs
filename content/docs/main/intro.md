### Intro

**_Welcome_** to the _**fourth**_ edition of our camp, where we come together to **_learn_**, **_play_**, and **_grow_** as a community. Our focus is on **rope**, but we also value **self-organization** and **resourcefulness**. This camp is entirely run by volunteers, so we rely on _**everyone**_ to pitch in and help with tasks such as food preparation, building and maintenance, cleaning, and taking care of each other. We believe that by working together and supporting each other, we can create a truly special and memorable experience for everyone.

At **Rogue Rope**, we provide the necessary infrastructure to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. This includes a space to pitch your tent, food and drink to keep you nourished, suspension points for rope activities, a sound system for music and events, power and water, toilets and warm showers to freshen up. However, we rely on you, the participant, to bring the entertainment, workshops, and creativity to the party.

This isn't just a festival where there's a divide between the audience and the performers – there are **_no spectators here, only participants_**. We see this camp as a playground, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with your ideas and talents. Whether you're a seasoned performer or just looking to try something new, we encourage you to step up and contribute to the magic of the camp.

> **We'll provide the stage, but it's up to you to put on the show.**
