### Intro

This is the third iteration of the camp, so far it has only gotten bigger and better. The main course from our buffet is rope, with a side of anarchy/self-organisation and a dash of Mac Guyver.

The setup is volunteer driven, so **everyone needs to participate.**

This means: helping with food-preparation, cleaning, making content, taking care of each other.

### What does Rogue Rope provide?

Rogue rope is focused on infrastructure: we provide a space, a place to pitch your tent, stuff to eat and drink. Suspension points. A sound-system. Water and power, toilets and warm showers.

We don't provide: shows, workshops, entertainment, bamboo. This is up to you, the participant.

### What does the participant provide?

This is not a festival where there's a divide between the audience and the artists on stage. There are ni spectatators, only participants.

This is a playground with a bunch of toys, an empty dance floor waiting to be filled, a forest waiting to be magical.

We create the stage, but **you the participant** perform the show.
