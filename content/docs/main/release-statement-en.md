## Rogue Rope Release Form

TL;DR: Rogue Rope is explicitly not a non-profit organization, but a de facto association (feitelijke vereniging). In short, this means that everything that happens during the activity falls under the full responsibility of the participants of the activity.

Long form:
An unincorporated association has no legal personality. Therefore, it cannot be sued. Members of a de facto association rely on their personal patrimony for the commitments entered into in the name of the de facto association or which have been caused to others in the event of damage. The liability of the members is therefore unlimited, with each of them in principle having to intervene for the proportional part of the debt of the association.

Liability may in some cases be collective. Each member will then be held jointly and severally or equally liable for the costs and obligations entered into jointly.

Liability can also be individual for certain acts, such as in the case of damage. This means that the member who made a mistake will generally be the only one to be prosecuted.

By signing this form, the undersigned (the “Participant”) agrees that neither Rogue Rope nor their associates, instructors and attendants shall be liable for any injury or damage of any kind, for any material or immaterial damage including direct, special, indirect or consequential damages, arising out of or in connection with visiting or participating in bondage or other activities through Rogue Rope unless there is willful recklessness or intent on the part of the organization.

The undersigned is aware that participation in the activities through Rogue Rope is at your own expense and risk.

The participant is considered responsible for respecting his own limits and limitations. When the activity takes place with several partners, the participants commit themselves to making agreements about risks and limits themselves.

Look at it a bit like a skate track, it's not because we built an 8 meter half-pipe that you have to ride off it on your plankske.

It is the Participant's own responsibility to assess whether or not he/she can participate.

If reckless or transgressive behavior is not waived after an interpellation, the organization has the right to immediately exclude the participant from the activities. This refusal may be for a definite or indefinite period.

If you are a participant and you see something you have doubts about, you can report it.

This disclaimer must be completed in full and submitted before the start of the activity.
