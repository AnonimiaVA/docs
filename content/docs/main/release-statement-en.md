## Rogue Rope Release Form

TL;DR: Rogue Rope is **not** a non-profit organization, but a de facto association (feitelijke vereniging). In short, this means that everything that happens during the event falls under the full responsibility of the event **participants**.

Long form:
An unincorporated association has no legal personality. Therefore, it cannot be sued. Members of a de facto association rely on their personal patrimony for the commitments entered into in the name of the de facto association or which have been caused to others in the event of damage. The liability of the members is therefore unlimited, with each of them in principle having to participate in the proportional part of the debt of the association.

Liability may in some cases be collective. Each member will then be held jointly and severally or equally liable for the costs and obligations entered into jointly.

Liability can also be individual for certain acts, such as in the case of damage. This means that the member who made a mistake will generally be the only one to be prosecuted.

By signing this form, the undersigned (the “Participant”) agrees that neither Rogue Rope nor its associates, instructors and attendants shall be liable for any injury or damage of any kind, for any material or immaterial damage, including direct, special, indirect or consequential damages, arising out of or in connection with visiting or participating in bondage or other activities organized by Rogue Rope, unless the organization engages in willful recklessness or intent.

The undersigned is aware that participation in the activities organized by Rogue Rope is at their own expense and risk.

The Participant is considered responsible for respecting their own limits and limitations. When an activity takes place with several partners, all Participants commit themselves to making agreements about risks and limits themselves.

The principle behind the event is like the one behind a skate track: it's not because we built an 8-meter half-pipe that you have to ride off it on your plankske.

It is the Participant's own responsibility to assess whether or not they can participate.

If reckless or transgressive behavior is not waived after an interpellation, the organization has the right to immediately remove the participant from the event. This refusal may be for a definite or indefinite period, at the organization's discretion.

If a Participant sees something they have doubts about, they can report it to the organization.

This disclaimer must be completed in full and submitted before the start of the activity.
