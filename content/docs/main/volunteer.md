The deal is very simple: no-one is employed, every participant pays for their ticket. We're in this boat together and we can make it either conquer the seas or crash into a big iceberg. It's really up to us, and by "us", we _really_ mean **you**.

So, we need you to lend a hand. You will be required to volunteer at least 1 time. Please take into account that most shifts don't require a lot of work. For example, the cleanup shifts usually don't take longer than 25 minutes.

### Different Ways to Help

You can choose one **one** or **many** of them.

#### Kitcheneer

Provide food and drinks to people. Help out in the kitchen.  
**You chop, slice, peel, heat, distribute and clean.**  
Make people smile by the power of your good vibes combined with drinks and snacks.

#### Production

Make stuff happen, **move things around**, rig things.  
But also **do cleaning** and improvise.  
**Work smart, not hard.**

#### Support

Welcome committee and greeters, crowd control, tent oversight.  
Nudging people to do the right thing is your thing.  
You know **a smile accomplishes more than a grumble**.  
Candidates _must_ agree to put on a fluorescent jacket.

### What If There Aren't Enough Volunteers?

Well, then the food won't be set up, the place won't get cleaned and nothing gets done. But we can still go outside to lie down in a puddle of mud. :-)

### Other Ways to Help

There are countless other ways to get involved, including:

* Arriving early for build or staying late for clean-up/strike
* Creating and bringing art
* Running a workshop
* Making music
* Putting on a show / performance

Feel free to create your own way to participate!

### How to Register?

We will be using a Google sheet, and make a print for people to join on site as well. Put your name down for a shift you think you might like. If you don't find the time to sign up before you arrive, you will be asked to do so when you check in.
