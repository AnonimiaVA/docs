The deal is very simple: no-one is employed, every participant pays for their ticket. We're in this boat together and we can make it either conquer the seas or crash into a big iceberg. It's really up to us, and by "us", we _really_ mean **you**.

So, we need you to lend a hand. You will be required to volunteer at least 1 time. Please take into account that most shifts don't require a lot of work. For example, the cleanup shifts usually don't take longer than 25 minutes.

### Different Ways to Help

You can choose one **one** or **many** of them.

#### Kitcheneer

Provide food and drinks to people. Help out in the kitchen.  
**You chop, slice, peel, heat, distribute and clean.**  
Make people smile by the power of your good vibes combined with drinks and snacks.

#### Production

Make stuff happen, **move things around**, rig things.  
But also **do cleaning** and improvise.  
**Work smart, not hard.**
At our camp, we operate on a simple system: no one is paid and every participant pays for their own ticket. This means that we're all in this together and it's up to us to make it a success. And by "us," we really mean you – we need your help to make this camp run smoothly. 

To pitch in, we ask that every participant volunteers at least one time. Don't worry, most shifts aren't too demanding – for example, cleanup shifts usually only take about 25 minutes. 

There are several ways you can contribute:

- **Kitcheneer**: Help out in the kitchen by preparing and serving food and drinks. You'll chop, slice, peel, heat, distribute, and clean, all while spreading good vibes and making people smile.

- **Production**: Get things done by moving and rigging equipment, but also be ready to clean and improvise. Work smart, not hard.

- **Support**: Welcome committee and greeters, crowd control, tent oversight – if nudging people to do the right thing is your thing, this is the role for you. Candidates must agree to put on a fluorescent jacket.

But what if there aren't enough volunteers? Then unfortunately, things like food preparation and cleaning may not get done. However, we can always find ways to have fun and make the most of our time together – even if it means lying down in a puddle of mud. :wink

### How to Register?

We will be using a Google sheet, and make a print for people to join on site as well. Put your name down for a shift you think you might like. If you don't find the time to sign up before you arrive, you will be asked to do so when you check in.
