All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.

We invite you to showcase your talents, whether it's related to rope or not. From spoken word to dance demonstrations, or even a magical act with a bunny, we're excited to see what you can do!

Share your unique skills and delight us all.

To express your interest in performing, please inform the content coordinators at the camp. Keep in mind that performances may take place outdoors. If you require music, bring your MP3 files on a thumb drive or provide a Spotify playlist. If you need assistance with this, reach out to us in advance, and we'll be happy to help.
