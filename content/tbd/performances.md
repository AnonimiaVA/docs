Maybe we can do some performances on Friday, doesn't have to be rope.  
Maybe you do spoken word, or can give a dance demo, maybe you can pull a bunny out of your hat instead of suspending it to the ceiling?

Share your skill and surprise us.

If you want to do a performance, let us know on the event. We might do the performances outside. For technical reasons, if you need music bring your MP3's on a thumb drive with you. If we can help you with this, let us know in advance.
